# A *toasty* detour
Hi!

So in continuation of my investigations I have found the website [Music From
Outer Space](https://musicfromouterspace.com) of late Ray Wilson.

This seems to be the be-al and end-all of Synth-DIY. I now plan to build
a [*Noise
Toaster*](https://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?CATPARTNO=NOISETOASTERPCB&PROJARG=NOISETOASTER%2FNOISETOASTER.php&MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&SONGID=NONE&VPW=1430&VPH=570) in order to get my skills high enough to be able to design
synth modules by myself. It is a "Level 1" project according to the author, and
features most of the components that I want to include in my design :
- VCO
- VCA
- LFO
- White noise generator
- Low-pass filter
- AR (lacks DS) envelope generator.

I hope that by looking hard enough at the schematics I will understand the
basic principles of each components.

Moreover I need to plan this whole thing, as I don't have a soldering station
at home.

I also found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PATlf0W3m7k) video from
Ryan Boggs who built a replica of the Minimoog. He shares some tips on
manipulating analog electronics (such as matching components and doing
measurments without heating components).

Anyways, that's all for now folks!
