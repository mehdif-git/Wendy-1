# First post : Hello World!

## Introducion

Hi! My name is Mehdi, I'm a 21-year-old currently studying Aerospace
Engineering. My favorite musical genre is electronic music and so, I have been
always amazed at sythesizers. Having had courses on basic signal analysis and
electronics and pretty much no musical background I find that they are much
simpler to understand than more classical instruments (at last, an instrument
that works on the principle that music is "just" a bunch of waves at different
frequencies!).

I am therefore starting this personal project to build a simple synth with only
the necessary tools (a few VCOs/Waveform generators, VCAs, LFOs, VCFs, ADSR
controller, fader, noise generator, mixer and delay - though if I only
implement only half of that, I'd be already pretty happy!- perhaps MIDI
controller too). The idea had been running in my mind for a few years now, and
I think I now have enough understanding of electronics to undertake this
project. This will be a long endeavour with lots of things that I'll be able to
learn I am sure.

## Planning

I plan to make this a multi-faceted project, mostly focused on the electronics
but also having parts of CAD and content creation around the developement.

First part will be searching on what I need/what would make for a good
architecture. Once that's done, schematics, PCBs and BOMs can be made and
explained. In parallel an enclosure can be designed.

I expect this project to take about a year to complete, considering I will only
be working on it from time to time and on my own funds.

## Documentation

For initil documentation I am basing myself on the works of [*Moritz Klein*](https://www.youtube.com/@MoritzKlein-1) and
*Dean Friedman*. The former makes video tutorials on synth circuits and more
details can be found on their Patreon page. The latter published the book
[*Synthesizer
Basics*](https://archive.org/details/SynthesizerBasicsDeanFriedman598dpi_201608)
in 1985. The book is freely available on the Internet Archive.

## Tools

" A good craftsman never blames his tools" but he may praise them :).

- To get a good understanding of the architecture that I will be building, I will
use [**VCV Rack**](https://vcvrack.com/). It allows to completely simulate
a modular synthesizer (some people even use it to make music!). It is free and
open-source software (which is always a plus to me). A paid version is
available to get integration with DAW software and some more modules but this
is way beyond the scope of this project.

- For the electronics, [**KiCad**](https://kicad.org) is my weapon of choice.
  For free and open-source (again, cool!) industrial software it is incredibly powerful and
  completely suited for this project. I have already made some PCBs with it and
  I can't recommend this tool enough for anyone wanting to get started in
  electronics.

- The physical enclosure will surely be made using **CATIAv5** or **3DX**
  (*Dassault Syst√®mes intensifies*). I might tryout FreeCAD though.
