title : Wendy-1, my first synth
---

Wendy-1 (named in honor of the synth music and engineering pioneer Wendy Carlos) is my attempt to build a simple synthetizer from first principles.

I heavily base myself on the tutorials of Moritz Klein and the book Synthesizer Basics of Dean Friedman. These sources and others are listed in the References folder.

Schematics, PCB layouts and BOMs are in the Electronics folder. These are made using KiCad.

CAD Files of the physical assembly are in the CAD folder. These are made using 3DX, CATIA V5 and FreeCAD.

Additional notes and log reports are in the Notes folder.

For now the project is a WiP and is mostly thouhght up as a way to apply signal analysis and electronic theory.
